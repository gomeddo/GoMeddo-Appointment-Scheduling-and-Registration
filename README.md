# Usecase 3 - Dentist appointment
I want to book a dentist appointment of type “checkup” for “Children” in Amsterdam on date X. 
It should return the slots you can book, this takes into account Resource and Staff availability.›
Configure SF, to have a resource structure with Country/City/Building/Room. 
Have a list of staff members with Skills. , who have an Multi Dimensional availability in certain buildings only. (meaning dentist A is only available in Resouce Z). Create a rule for certain reservations types need certain skills.
